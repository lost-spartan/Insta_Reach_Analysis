# Results from indivisual python codes python Codes

## From Code 1:
 The code shows **bar graph** to show the total number of impressions made by all the post from the Instagram sections they had namely Home, Hashtags, Explore and Others.

## From Code 2:
 The code shows a **pie chart** to show the percentage of impressions made by all the post from the Instagram sections they had namely Home, Hashtags, Explore and Others.

## From Code 3:
The code shows a multiplotted plotter graph where the relationship is visualized between number of likes and the impressions a post had. The graph showed the results from Home, Hashtag and Explore sections. The plotter points shows the number of likes on a single post and the reach it gained, while the gradient line shows the average trend of the realation from that section.
  - It was found that the number of likes were in direct proportional to the number of reach.
  - It can be deduced from the chart that if a post gained high reach most of the likes were from Explore and Hashtag sections.
  - It can be deduced from the chart that if a post gained low reach most of the likes were from Home and Hashtag sections.
  - It was found that, when the impression on a perticular post reached between 4.5 K to 5 K, the number of likes from each section was almost equal.

## From Code 4:
  - If reach increases the relative number of comments that are gained from Hashtag section increases.
  - If reach increases the relative number of comments that are gained from Exlore section decreses.
  - On the other hand the relative number of comments that are gained from Home remains constant. This line of Home section also shows that the comments that are made from the Impression from Home section are different but the reach the gain is also always constant which is somewhat near to 2500.

## From Code 5:
  - The conversion rate was around 41
  - It was found that most of the new Profile visits (higest density) are less 100 visits and out of those vistis, in most of the cases only less than 20 people star following the page.
